										Hello, I'm Gaganpreet Kaur, a dynamic professional with a unique journey from academia to data science,
										infusing a passion for extracting insights from data and transforming them into impactful business solutions.
									</p>
									<p>
										In my 4-year role as an Assistant Professor at the Ramgarhia Institute of Technology, I not only effectively communicated
										complex concepts in Engineering Physics but also developed a keen interest in data management and analysis tools,
										particularly Microsoft Excel. This sparked my transition into the world of data science during a postgraduate academic project,
										leading to a transformative experience in BrainStation's Data Science Diploma Program.
									</p>
									<p>
										Amidst the challenges of the pandemic, I reinvented my professional path, unveiling a newfound passion for coding and data science.
										Engaging in the EY & BrainStation Remote 3D Hackathon, I collaborated on "Safe Eats," a digital solution for small-medium businesses
										during the COVID-19 era. This immersive program equipped me with proficiency in SQL, Python, Tableau, and various machine and deep
										learning techniques.
									</p>
									<p>
										My journey extends into healthcare, where I managed the comprehensive lifecycle of patient data within the HCL Database.
										Collaborating seamlessly with cross-functional teams, I addressed and resolved issues, optimizing data management processes.
										Additionally, I administered financial reports using QuickBooks and utilized Microsoft Excel for inventory management, showcasing
										my versatility in data management tools.
									</p>
									<p>
										In retail, I led a team, educated associates, and established a new overnight team at Walmart. Utilizing advanced Microsoft Excel
										data tools, including VBA, Pivot Tables, and Excel Formulas, I identified sales patterns, monitored inventory, and analyzed product
										offerings. Collaboration with management resulted in an impressive 70% increase in retention rates.
									</p>
									<p>
										What sets me apart is not only my technical prowess but also my collaborative and leadership skills. Whether in academia, retail,
										or healthcare, I bring a holistic approach to problem-solving. As a physicist turned data analyst, I've leveraged analytical skills
										to solve complex problems in diverse sectors.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am excited about the prospect of applying my diverse skill set to new challenges and contributing to the success of your organization.
										My commitment to delivering impactful business solutions, coupled with a collaborative approach, positions me as a valuable asset for
										any role or company.
